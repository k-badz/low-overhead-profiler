// You can set this to "true" to enable what is called "safer" mode.
// This mode will attempt to check for buffer exhaustion in the assembly and will try to
// recover from such situation by disabling the profiler, doing necessary operations, and re-enabling it.
// This mode is highly experimental and might not be tested enough.
// Side effects:
// - during recovery process some events will be lost
// - tracing overhead might be increased by around 1 nanosecond / event
// - the asynchronous flushing of events to disk might create many threads if you continue to
//   emit events faster than they are flushed for long time
// To enable, set this to true, and also find macros with same name
// in the profiler_asm.cpp (Linux) or profiler_asm.asm (Windows) and also set them to true or 1.
// You will find appropriate comment near them in their respective files.
#define LOP_SAFER false

// This is additional variation of mode explained above. When you enable "safer" mode above, on
// top of that you can also enable lossless mode which will not loose events during the recovery.
// As above, it requires support both in cpp and asm files so change both.
// Side effects:
// - much lower performance (like 16ns/event), because we are not stopping the profiler in that
//   case, we need to do interlocked increments to the event buffers (due to hot swap)

// store the pointer, because copying it around would kill the performance. So it is safest
